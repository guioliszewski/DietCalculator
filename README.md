# Diet Calculator (TDEE)

This project is a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) Calculator designed to help users estimate the number of calories they burn per day based on their personal information and activity level. Users input data such as age, gender, weight, height, and exercise habits. The calculator first determines the user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and then multiplies it by an activity factor to estimate daily caloric needs.

The calculator also provides daily caloric recommendations based on the userâ€™s current goal (cutting, bulking, or maintaining), as well as daily macronutrient and micronutrient needs based on scientific literature.
